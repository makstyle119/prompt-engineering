this is my journey to learn and understand Prompt Engineering

# Question & Answer

**Q1- what is Prompt Engineering ?** <br />
**A1- Prompt Engineering** is a new to writing, refining and optimizing prompts in a structured way.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - write, refine and optimize prompts
    - perfect the interaction between humans and AI
    - continuous monitor those prompts
    - maintain an up to date prompt library

**Q2- what is AI - (Artificial Intelligence) ?** <br />
**A2- AI - (Artificial Intelligence)** is the simulation of human intelligence processes by a machine.

**Q3- what is ML - (Machine Learning) ?** <br />
**A3- ML - (Machine Learning)** is the process AI uses to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

**Q4- what is Linguistics ?** <br />
**A4- Linguistics** is the study of language (it's the key of prompt engineering).
- consist of 10 things:
    1. Phonetics
        - The study of how speech sounds are produced and perceived
    2. Phonology
        - The study of sound patterns and changes
    3. Morphology
        - The study of word structure
    4. Syntax
        - The study of sentence structure
    5. Semantics
        - The study of linguistic meaning
    6. Pragmatics
        - The study of how language is used in context
    7. historical
        - The study of language change
    8. Sociolinguistics
        - The study of the relation between language and society
    9. Computational
        - The study of how computers can process human language
    10. Psycholinguistics
        - The study of how humans acquire and use language

**Q5- what is a Language Model ?** <br />
**A5- Language Model** is a smart program which train on books, articles and other source of texts to generate human like conversation/text/story.
It work something like this:
- you give a sentence as input
- it will analyze the sentence as per grammar rules, order of words and other things
- and it will generate a continuation of the sentence as per it's training

**Q6- what is a Prompt ?** <br />
**A6- Prompt** is a string of text that is used as input to a language model. It is used to guide the language model's output.

**Q7- what is a Prompt Library ?** <br />
**A7- Prompt Library** is a collection of prompts that are used to guide the language model's output.
- it is a collection of prompts that are used to guide the language model's output.

# Steps
1. Clear Instructions
    - make sure you provide clear instruction about what you need and what you don't need
2. Adopt a persona
    - give AI a persona that is relevant to the task/project/person you are working on
3. Specify the format
    - specify the format of the output
4. Avoid leading the Answer
5. Limit the scope
